# SHAPEAI PYTHON AND DATA VISUALIZATION BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Ashish modi (Expert at SHAPE AI  ). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li> INTRO TO PYTHON
<li> INTRODUCTION TO DATA VISUALISATION
<li> FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN HOW TO INTERPRET DATA
<li> HANDS-ON PROJECT

<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
